SPQR is a PCVR/PS5VR EU-only SND 5v5 matchup format for adult, experienced players, active on multiple weekdays, usually between 18 and 22 UTC.

no need for a team, just join discord and signup for matches, where teams are somewhat randomized, but with an eye on balance and fairness.

**SPQR Gladiator Requirements:**
- english-speaking
- adults only (be nice and act responsibly)
- a certain amount of skill (to enable teamplay)
- decent internet connection to EU servers is required (50ms ping soft limit, 60ms ping hard limit, normal stability)

if this sounds like what you are looking for, please join and contact a member with the orange "SPQR Senate" role for more information.
